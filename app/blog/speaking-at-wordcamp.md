So thanks to my awesome boss Ed @ [Integrity](http://integritystl.com) I was recommended, and will be giving a chat with my rad comrade Arod this year at WordCamp in St. Louis.

We're planning a chat for developers that focuses on how to architect a really awesome WordPress theme. Our focus is on how using custom post types, custom meta boxes, and admin customizations can make WordPress a true CMS and easy for clients to learn.

I'm posting the slides on a new service I found created by the guys at [Github](http://github.com) called [Speaker Deck](http://speakerdeck.com). I like the so far and its simple. It creates your presentation in by uploading a pdf, this makes prep minimal and I get to avoid powerpoint.

Arod and I still have plenty of prep to do but we're super excited. This will be the first year we have presented and my third WordCamp to attend.

Check back for a follow up post on the details of the event and links to the slides from our chat

**UPDATE**

Arod and I had a great session that was standing room only! We totally enjoyed the experience and had some really encouraging feedback.

Here are the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/ollo/wcstl12) from the presentation for all those interested
